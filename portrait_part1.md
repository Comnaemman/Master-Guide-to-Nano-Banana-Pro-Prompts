## 4. London outdoor restaurant portrait with Nano Banana Pro

*A photorealistic prompt for a young woman at a calm London outdoor restaurant on a crisp March morning, with shallow depth of field and candid phone-photo vibes.*

```
Create a photorealistic image of a young woman sitting at a relaxed outdoor restaurant in {argument name="city in english" default="London"} on a cool Wednesday morning in March {argument name="year in english" default="2025"}. The sky is clear, the spring air is crisp, and the city feels calm as it wakes up. She is the focal point of the shot—wearing a light scarf, gently stirring her tea while gazing off to the side with a thoughtful expression. Everything behind her, from the waiter moving about to the soft morning traffic, should fall into a smooth blur, giving the picture the effortless, candid atmosphere of a moment casually snapped on a phone.

## 6. Edo-period Ukiyo-e reinterpretation of a modern scene

*A highly-structured image prompt to depict a modern-day scene reimagined as an Edo-period Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock print, with detailed guidance on anachronistic tech, composition, texture, and color.*

```
A Japanese Edo-period Ukiyo-e woodblock print. The overall feeling is a surreal collaboration between masters like Hokusai and Hiroshige, reimagining modern technology through an ancient lens.

**The scene:** {argument name="modern scene" default="a busy Shibuya scramble crossing"}

**Edo transformation logic:**
Characters wear Edo-era kimono but perform modern actions. All technology is transformed into surreal Edo equivalents:
* Smartphones are glowing, illustrated paper scrolls being read intently.
* Metro stations and trains are giant articulated wooden centipede carriages shuffling through crowds.
* Skyscrapers are reimagined as endless, towering wooden pagodas reaching into dramatic clouds.
* Robots and mecha appear as giant, armored woodblock golems.

The composition uses a flattened perspective with large, bold, hand-carved ink outlines. The background features heavily stylized Ukiyo-e wave patterns and dramatic, swirling clouds, with a distant Mt. Fuji visible on the horizon.

The image must look like a physical print, not a digital painting.
* Texture: strong visible wood grain texture and rough paper fibers throughout the piece.
* Printing imperfections: pigment bleeding is evident. Simulate hand-pressed plates with slight color misalignment for authenticity.
* Color palette: strictly limited to traditional mineral pigments, with dominant use of Prussian blue, vermilion red, and muted yellow ochre.
* Lighting: soft, flat, shadow-free lighting with no digital gradients.

Aspect ratio is 3:4 vertical poster. Include vertical Japanese calligraphy describing the scene and a traditional red artist seal stamp in a corner.
```

Strong rim light accentuating his jawline and nose, dark minimalist background. Expression thoughtful and serene, cinematic lighting creating dramatic contrast and fine photographic detail.",
  "size": "{argument name="image size" default="1024x1024"}",
  "n": {argument name="number of images" default="1"}
}
```

## 8. Makoto Shinkai-style cinematic sky background illustration

*A prompt for generating wide 16:9 background illustrations in the style of Makoto Shinkai, focusing on spectacular skies and realistic urban or everyday environments, with the option to swap in your own scene.*

```
Generate a beautiful background illustration in the style of Makoto Shinkai’s animated films. The core scene is: "{argument name="scene" default="a railway crossing in full bloom with cherry blossoms"}", but the focus is not on characters; it is on the environment and the atmosphere of the sky.

Use a wide 16:9 composition, as if it were a single frame taken directly from a Shinkai movie. The sky must be the absolute protagonist, occupying most of the frame. Paint an extremely spectacular, detail-rich sky: for example, a towering cumulonimbus cloud stretching to the heavens, or gorgeous evening clouds where orange, purple, and deep blue gradients interweave, or a huge rainbow arching over the city after the rain. The lighting should be at the most magical time of day, either Golden Hour or Blue Hour. Include strong yet soft lens flares in the sky, with sunlight streaming through gaps in the clouds to form clear volumetric rays, and tiny glowing dust motes and light particles drifting in the air.

For the ground and environment, render the {scene} in near photo-realistic detail: carefully depict utility poles, complex webs of power lines, road signs, traffic lights, vending machines, distant skyscraper silhouettes, and the small traces of everyday urban life. If the scene includes rain or puddles, the ground should look wet, reflecting the colors of the sky and nearby lights like a mirror, filling the image with a transparent, cool atmosphere and a sense of slight humidity.

In terms of composition, use a wide-angle, large-scale view to emphasize the grandeur of the environment and a strong sense of depth, making the viewer feel like they are looking up and being swallowed by the scenery. If there are characters in the image, they should be tiny silhouettes or back views, standing at a street corner, on a rooftop, or by the railway, gazing at the sky or the distance. Their small figures should enhance the sense of story, loneliness, and imagined future, without stealing the spotlight from the environment.

The overall color should be clear and saturated but not harsh. The contrast between light and shadow should be strong yet still soft, with enough detail that the image can be used directly as a desktop wallpaper. The style must clearly carry Shinkai’s signature sense of romance and transparency, rather than a heavy oil painting or pure photographic realism. High-resolution illustration, 16:9 widescreen ratio.
```

## 9. Persona 5-inspired pop-art anime poster for a custom chuunibyou character

*A dynamic pop-art anime prompt that turns any given character concept into an over-the-top, game-opening-style poster with bold cel-shading, graffiti elements, and UI overlays.*

```
Generate a visually explosive and trendy pop-art anime illustration. The main character of the image is "{argument name="character" default="an over-the-top chuunibyou knight"}", and the overall style should reference Persona 5 and street graffiti visuals, turning the character into an extremely flamboyant, extremely flat, ultra-cool anime figure.

Use sharp cel-shading for the character, with hard, clean lines and crisp contours. The pose must be exaggerated and full of motion. You can use wide-angle or fisheye perspectives so that hands, weapons, or props appear extremely close to the camera, like a freeze-frame at the moment a special attack is unleashed. The expression should be highly dramatic, with confident, manic, or cold-blooded "overacting" intensity, rather than a calm everyday look.

Reject realistic volume and shading; instead, rely on large areas of pure black heavy shadows and highly saturated flat color blocks to create an extreme, high-contrast flat look. The main colors can be bright red, lemon yellow, electric blue, neon purple, etc., contrasted against large black shadow silhouettes. Add screentones, halftone dots, speed lines, and radiating lines in the shadows and background so the image feels like printed manga layered with street graffiti.

The background does not need realistic perspective space; it should be a flat visual collage stage filled with huge sans-serif English letters, torn paper effects, ink splatters, bold arrow graphics, speech bubbles, and onomatopoeia, such as exaggerated "BOOM", "SLASH", or "WAKE UP" graffiti sound effects. You can integrate UI elements into the scene—health bars, skill names, buttons, numbers, tooltips—floating around the main character, as if the game interface and the illustration have merged, breaking the fourth wall.

Keep lighting high-contrast but not physically realistic; think in terms of graphic design areas of black/white/color rather than natural light logic. Edges between color areas on the character and background should be very sharp, without soft gradients; all colors should be clearly separated. You can add rough spray paint, smears, or hand-drawn graffiti textures in select areas to enhance the street and handmade feel.

The overall mood must be extremely dynamic, extremely chuunibyou, and extremely cool, as if the image is about to explode out of the screen, not quietly hang in a gallery. Avoid realistic oil painting styles, low-saturation vintage looks, or gentle, soft illustration styles. Do not use natural landscapes or everyday life backgrounds, and avoid soft, pastel color schemes. The image should be a vertical 2:3 high-resolution illustration, suitable as a tension-filled, maximalist pop-art manga poster.
```

## 10. Compact digital camera screen portrait prompt

*A detailed nano-banana-pro prompt for generating a nostalgic 2000s-style compact digital camera shot showing a close-up portrait on the camera’s rear screen, with specific composition, lighting, and camera settings.*

```
Use the facial features from the attached photo. On the screen of a small Canon compact digital camera, show a close-up shot of {argument name="character description" default="a young woman"}. The camera body surrounds the image, with its buttons, dials and textured surfaces clearly visible, including the FUNC/SET wheel, the DISP button, and the “IMAGE STABILIZER” label on the side. The photo on the screen is taken {argument name="time and environment" default="indoors at night"}, with a bright built‑in flash illuminating {argument name="character term" default="the woman"}'s face and hair, creating sharp highlights on her skin and strands of hair. She has {argument name="hair color and style" default="dark long hair loosely falling beside her cheeks"}, her lips slightly parted, with a soft expression. The flash emphasizes her facial features, while the background is {argument name="background setting" default="a dim, cluttered kitchen"}, where appliances, shelves, and metal surfaces are faintly visible with a gentle bokeh effect. The overall atmosphere is natural, realistic, and nostalgic, reminiscent of {argument name="era feeling" default="early‑2000s digital camera snapshots"}. The color tones are slightly cool and soft, with strong contrast from the flash, and the screen display has a natural grainy texture. There is no text or logo inside the photo preview.

Aspect ratio: {argument name="aspect ratio" default="4:5 vertical"}

Camera: compact digital camera simulation
Lens: 28–35mm equivalent
Aperture: f/2.8
ISO: 400
Shutter speed: 1/60 s (with flash)
White balance: auto flash
Lighting: the subject is lit by strong direct flash, with weak ambient light in the background
Color grading style: {argument name="color grading style" default="nostalgic digital‑camera tones, high‑contrast flash look, fine screen grain, realistic screen glow"}.
```

## 11. Fisheye selfie with movie characters using Nano Banana Pro

*A detailed image prompt for generating hyper-realistic fisheye-style group selfies that combine the uploaded person with chosen movie characters, mimicking vintage 35mm flash photography.*

```
A film-like fisheye wide-angle 360-degree selfie without any camera or phone visible in the subject’s hands. A real and exaggerated selfie of {argument name="person from uploaded image in english" default="person from uploaded image"} with {argument name="characters in english" default="their favorite movie characters"}. They are making faces at the camera.

A hyper-realistic fisheye wide-angle selfie, captured with a vintage 35mm fisheye lens creating heavy barrel distortion, without any camera or phone visible in the subject’s hands.
Subject & Action: A close-up, distorted group photo featuring {argument name="person from uploaded image in english" default="person from uploaded image"} taking a selfie with {argument name="characters in english" default="their favorite movie characters"}. Everyone is making wild, exaggerated faces, squinting slightly from the flash.
Lighting & Texture: Harsh, direct on-camera flash lighting that creates hard shadows behind the subjects. Authentic film grain, slight motion blur on the edges, and chromatic aberration. It looks like a candid, amateur snapshot as if captured during a chaotic behind-the-scenes moment, not a studio photo.

## 19. Nano Banana Pro meme-style clothing cut lines illustration prompt

*A structured Japanese prompt for Nano Banana Pro that redraws a character as a meme-style illustration showing dotted cut lines with like and repost counts, while preserving only design elements from a reference image.*

```
[Purpose]
Create a "meme-style illustration where clothes get cut away based on ♥ and 🔄 counts" by referring to a user-uploaded character image, inheriting only the design elements while redrawing the facial expression and pose.

[Handling of the reference]
- Refer only to hairstyle, colors, outfit, and overall vibe
- The facial expression and pose must always be newly redrawn
- Do not make a complete copy of the reference image

[Composition]
- Framing from bust-up to waist, mostly facing front
- Place the character on the left side
- Background is simple white
- In front of the character, place **five short horizontal dotted lines** (they should not extend across the entire canvas, only slightly longer than the character’s width)
- The five horizontal lines divide at the shoulders, chest, abdomen, waist, and crotch. Always draw all five horizontal lines
- Place a ✂ icon to the left of the top horizontal dotted line
- On the right side of each horizontal line, place ♥ / 🔄 plus numbers, aligned exactly to the vertical center of each dotted line
- Add a small "diagram showing how the outfit is being cut" in the upper-right corner (do not include text)

[Right side labels (from top to bottom)]
1. ♥5,000 (bright red)
2. 🔄1,000 (bright yellow-green)
3. ♥1,000 (bright red)
4. 🔄250 (bright yellow-green)
5. ♥100 (bright red)
- 🔄 should look like the repost icon on X
- All fonts should be cute, handwritten style

[Character depiction]
- Include external features that clearly show it is the referenced character (hair, eyes, colors, outfit, etc.)
- Blushing expression that mixes embarrassment and being upset
- A shy pose that tries to hide the body
- Keep the outfit based on the reference without changing it; do not cut or remove clothes

[Illustration style]
- Pop, cute 2D anime style
- Soft, loose line art with bright colors
- Prioritize readability as a meme image
- No unnecessary decorations, keep the layout clean and simple

## 20. Snow globe character illustration prompt for Nano Banana Pro

*A detailed Japanese prompt for Nano Banana Pro to create a chibi anime-style character inside a realistic snow globe with specific props, lighting, and restrictions.*

```
Maintain the characteristics of the character from the attached reference image, and depict them as a default chibi character in anime style striking an uncool pose. Place a small raccoon dog on their head.
The character is placed inside a realistically rendered snow globe, where fantastical powdery snow is falling and piling up in a dramatic night scene. The base of the globe is decorated with LED illumination.
The snow globe is displayed on a warm wooden desk, with a candle a little farther back. On the fogged window, only the part where the phrase "(ᐢ⓿ᴥ⓿ᐢ) たぬ参上" is traced in a handwritten-looking font allows a view of the snowy Japanese landscape outside.
Do not show any human fingers. Do not make the raccoon dog’s tail striped.

## 21. Normal and depth map generation prompts for Nano Banana Pro

*Two English prompts for Nano Banana Pro to generate a tangent-space normal map and a physically plausible depth map from an input artwork image, suitable for 3D-style viewing via WebGL or Three.js.*

```
Generate a surface normal map from the input artwork image.

Output one RGB image where each pixel encodes the surface normal direction in standard tangent-space format:
• R = X direction
• G = Y direction
• B = Z direction

Requirements:
• Maintain the same resolution and aspect ratio as the input image.
• Normal directions must follow the local geometry implied by brush strokes, shading, and contours.
• Do NOT add new artistic elements or repaint the scene.
• Only infer plausible micro-geometry and surface orientation.
• Ensure smooth, consistent normal transitions without noise.

Generate a depth map from the input artwork image.

Output a single grayscale depth map where:
• White = near to the viewer
• Black = far from the viewer

Requirements:
• Maintain the same resolution and aspect ratio as the input image.
• Depth must be smooth, continuous, and physically plausible.
• Infer only geometric depth that could reasonably exist in the original artwork.
• Do NOT add new objects or details.
• Do NOT stylize, repaint, or reinterpret the scene.
• Avoid texture noise; focus solely on depth structure.

## 23. Ultra-realistic 16K selfie edit of a daydreaming girl on a blanket

*A detailed editing prompt for Nano Banana Pro that transforms a selfie of a young girl lying on a blanket into an ultra-realistic 16K iPhone-style photo, specifying her hair, outfit, makeup, pose, lighting, and background while preserving her face.*

```
Edit the photo in ultra-realistic 16K resolution. A {argument name="subject age" default="young"} girl is taking a selfie inside a room. Her hair is long, layered {argument name="hair color" default="ash brown"}, slightly messy at the top, falling forward naturally. She is wearing a {argument name="dress description" default="black curly-strapped floral dress"}. Pose: she is lying face down on a blanket, with her right hand touching her lips, head tilted sideways, looking forward, appearing to be daydreaming. Her makeup is flawless, Korean-inspired with a modern touch: neatly shaped eyebrows, soft peach eyeshadow, thin eyeliner emphasizing her eyes, and soft gray contact lenses giving a captivating gaze. Her cheeks have a natural peach blush, and her lips are glossy, with a nude base lip color ombre'd into red, creating a soft yet striking contrast. The background is a {argument name="background material and color" default="cream marble wall"}. The photo is taken up-close at eye level. Lighting: cinematic and editorial, dim and dark to make the selfie look realistic, with retro purple contrast enhancing skin glow. The photo is captured with an {argument name="camera model" default="iPhone 17 Pro Max"}. Do not alter her face in any way.
