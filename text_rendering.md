## 1. 2005 Sony CyberShot mall food court snapshot prompt

*An image prompt that recreates an early-digital-camera mall food court photo with teens, harsh flash, date stamp, and Myspace-era aesthetics.*

```
A low-resolution digital photo taken on a 2005 Sony CyberShot. A group of teenagers hanging out in a mall food court. Harsh on-camera flash, slightly blown-out highlights, digital noise in the shadows. The skin texture looks slightly waxy due to early digital processing. An orange date stamp appears in the bottom right corner reading "{argument name="date stamp in english" default="04/12/2005"}". Candid, awkward angles, Myspace photo aesthetic.
