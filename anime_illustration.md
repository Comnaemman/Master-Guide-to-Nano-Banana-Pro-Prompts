## 3. City tallest buildings 3D cartoon showcase prompt

*A detailed prompt for generating a square 3D cartoon-style image of the three tallest buildings in a chosen city, with accurate proportions, labels for height and year, and clean typographic layout.*

```
Present a clear, side miniature 3D cartoon view of the tallest buildings in {argument name="city in English" default="YOUR CITY"}. Use minimal textures with realistic materials and soft, lifelike lighting and shadows. Use a clean, minimalistic composition showing exactly the three tallest buildings in {argument name="reference city in English" default="Sopot"}, arranged from left to right in strict descending height order. The tallest must appear visibly tallest, the second must be clearly shorter than the first, and the third must be clearly shorter than the second.
All buildings must follow accurate relative proportions: if a building is taller in real life, it must be taller in the image by the same approximate ratio. No building may be visually stretched or compressed.
Each building should stand separately on a thin, simple ceramic base. Below each base, centered text should display:
Height in meters — semibold sans-serif, medium size
Year built — lighter-weight sans-serif, smaller size, directly beneath the height text
Provide consistent padding, spacing, leading, and kerning. Write “{argument name="city name title" default="YOUR CITY NAME"}” centered above the buildings, using a medium-sized sans-serif font.
No building top should overlap or touch the text above. Use accurate architectural proportions based on real-world references. Maintain a consistent camera angle and identical scale for each building model.
No forced perspective. Use straight-on orthographic-style rendering. Do not exaggerate or stylize size differences beyond proportional accuracy.

Use a square 1080×1080 composition. Use a clean, neutral background. Ensure no extra objects are present.

Surround the main dish with carefully drawn ingredients, including labels, measurements, and utensils like bowls, whisks, or spoons. To create a homey, nostalgic feeling, use textured shading, warm pastel colors, and fine, ink-like outlines. Add handwritten-style recipe text, integrating the ingredients and directions organically into the layout.
