## 26. Cinematic lakeside hanging chair concept prompt with space object theme

*A long-form Nano Banana Pro prompt for a cinematic night scene at a lakeshore with a large hanging chair whose shape, surface, and lighting are derived from a specific space object placeholder.*

```
Cinematic night scene of a cozy outdoor retreat by a calm lakeshore. In the center, a large hanging chair inspired by {argument name="space object in English" default="[SPACE_OBJECT]"} floats just above the ground, suspended by sturdy metal chains from a thick, low tree branch on the left. The chair’s overall silhouette, proportions, color palette, and surface detailing are clearly derived from this celestial body, so its characteristic outline, light and dark regions, subtle bands, patches, and recognizable markings from astronomy images are faithfully translated into the design of the outer shell. The material looks like a refined, slightly weathered fusion of stone and metal with finely sculpted relief matching those distinctive patterns, while the interior forms a smooth, comfortable hollow lined with warm woven fibers and cushions that softly echo the same hues. A plush pillow rests inside, illuminated by a gentle glow from within the chair, casting a soft pool of light onto the surrounding earth and grass. Tall wild grasses and small plants encircle the base

## 27. Colossal battleship at dawn illustration prompt

*An English prompt for generating a cinematic low-angle image of a colossal battleship with triple turrets, towering superstructure, and dramatic sunrise lighting, evocative of historical warships.*

```
A colossal battleship sailing across calm ocean waters at dawn. Its hull is massive and dignified, forged from dark steel, with broad armored decks and three enormous triple-barreled turrets aligned along the ship’s central axis. Each gun barrel is long and heavy, angled slightly upward, as if prepared for a distant horizon. The towering superstructure rises high above the deck, layered with observation platforms, rangefinders, and radar domes. The bridge is tall and fortress-like, its silhouette sharp against the morning sky. Details of riveted armor plates, ladders, and gun mounts emphasize industrial craftsmanship and mechanical precision. The scene is illuminated by the first light of sunrise—a golden glow reflecting off gentle waves and steel surfaces. A sense of solemnity and pride fills the air, as if this ship carries the weight of history itself. The composition is cinematic and low-angled, looking upward from sea level to capture its overwhelming presence.

## 45. 3×3 cinematic storyboard contact sheet from one input image

*A detailed Nano Banana Pro instruction prompt that analyzes one reference image and generates a coherent 3×3 cinematic contact sheet of the same subject with different shot types while keeping identity, clothing and lighting consistent.*

```
Analyze the entire composition of the input image. Identify all key subjects present (whether a single person, group/couple, vehicle, or specific object) and their spatial relationships/interactions.
Generate a coherent 3×3 “contact sheet” grid that shows 9 different shots of exactly these subjects within the same environment.
You must adapt standard cinematic shot types to fit the content (for example, if it’s a group, keep the group together; if it’s an object, frame the entire object):
Row 1 (establishing the environment):
Extreme long shot (ELS): the subject appears small within a vast environment.
Long shot (LS): the full subject or group is visible from top to bottom (head to toe / wheels to roof).
Medium long shot (American shot / three-quarter): framed from above the knees (for people) or a 3/4 view (for objects).
Row 2 (core coverage):
4. Medium shot (MS): framed from the waist up (or the central core of an object). Focus on interaction/action.
5. Medium close-up (MCU): framed from the chest up. An intimate framing of the main subject.
6. Close-up (CU): tightly framed on the face or the “front” of the object.
Row 3 (details and angles):
7. Extreme close-up (ECU): intense focus on key features (eyes, hands, signs, textures) with macro-like detail.
8. Low-angle shot (worm’s-eye): look up at the subject from ground level (epic/heroic feeling).
9. High-angle shot (bird’s-eye): look down on the subject from above.
Ensure strict consistency: the same person/object, same clothing, and same lighting must appear in all 9 panels. Depth of field should vary realistically (with background blur in close-up shots).

Create a professional 3×3 cinematic storyboard grid with 9 panels.
The grid should present a specific subject/scene from the input image across a full range of focal lengths.
Top row: wide environmental shot, full-body view, 3/4 cropped (knees-up).
Middle row: waist-up view, chest-up view, face/front close-up.
Bottom row: macro details, low angle, high angle.
All frames must have photo-realistic textures, consistent cinematic color grading, and correct framing tailored to the number and type of subjects or objects being analyzed.

## 46. Professional profile photo prompt for Nano Banana Pro

*A detailed Korean prompt template for generating a professional high‑quality profile photo from an input image using Nano Banana Pro, with controlled framing, clothing, background color, lighting, lens, and mood.*

```
A high‑resolution, professional profile photo that preserves the exact facial structure, identity, and key features of the person in the input image. The subject is framed from the chest up with ample headroom. The person looks directly at the camera. Dress them in a luxurious smart‑casual blazer in a subtle charcoal gray color, styled like a professional photo studio shoot. The background is a solid neutral studio color of "{argument name="background color" default="#562226"}". Shoot from a high angle, using bright, well‑ventilated soft diffused studio lighting that gently illuminates the face and creates subtle catchlights in the eyes to convey clarity. Use an 85mm f/1.8 lens with shallow depth of field, with perfect focus on the eyes and beautiful, soft bokeh. Capture sharp detail in the blazer’s fabric texture, each strand of hair, and natural, realistic skin texture. The mood should radiate confidence, professionalism, and approachability. Apply clean, bright cinematic color grading with a subtle warmth and balanced tones to ensure a refined, modern look.
